    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Evoke is a wearable wrist device that captures and replays our sensory memories — not just images, but scent, sound, temperature, and even emotional tone. More than a smart device, it lets users relive lived experiences as they truly felt: the scent of your grandmother's cooking, the warmth of a festival evening, or the breeze from your childhood home. With a simple tap, these sensations can be replayed, shared with loved ones, or donated to a public memory archive.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as Evoke becomes part of everyday life, it raises complex questions. Who gets to preserve their memories in perfect clarity — and who is left out? In a future where memory is editable, tradable, and ownable, Evoke turns recollection into a form of power. The device helps build solidarity across distance, allowing long-distant families to share cultural memories or elders to pass on traditions. It fosters empathy and community, but also highlights inequities in who controls which stories are remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evoke doesn't just help us remember. It forces us to ask whose experiences we value, how we connect across differences, and what it really means to keep someone, or something, alive in memory.

    <p>
      Evoke is worn like a normal watch but contains a complex system of sensors. It collects sensory data using advanced micro sensors. Smells are identified using bio-reactive sensor that capture and decode airborne molecules. Directional microphones capture ambient sound and voice patterns, while environmental sensors log temperature and humidity. Skin sensors record emotional states using galvanic response.
    </p>
    <p>
      These inputs are processed and encoded into secure “memory capsules.” When you want to replay a moment, the device reconstructs these sensations through built-in emitters: scents released from microfluidic cartridges located on the surface of the watch, warmth or coolness simulated via thermoelectric pads planted in the wrist band, and gentle vibrations to evoke emotional atmospheres. Playback can be private or shared via your phone or public memory library.
    </p>
     <p>
      Playback can be private or shared via your phone or public memory library. Therefore, while the device is deeply personal, it's also built to be shared. That's what makes Evoke unique: it's not just about nostalgia or novelty, but about remembering together, preserving the everyday, the ordinary, and the deeply meaningful in ways never before possible.

    <h2>Life with Evoke</h2>
    <section class="world" id="world">
  <h3>A New Memory Culture</h3>
  <p>
    In the world of Evoke, remembering becomes more than just a personal act, it becomes a way of connecting, sharing, and shaping public life. People no longer describe memories with words or pictures alone. Instead, they send each other “memory capsules” — relivable packages of smells, sounds, emotions, and sensations. A daughter living abroad can feel the warmth of her home bedroom and mother's cooking. A refugee might revisit the scent of their hometown market. Elders pass down cultural memories not through stories, but through sensory experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Everyday Uses and Cultural Shifts</h3>
  <p>
    Society adapts to this shift in profound ways. Public spaces offer sensory memory booths for tourists. Universities use recorded memories as tools for cultural education. Artists build immersive installations from donated experiences. Even grief changes, people say goodbye not only with photos and ewords, but with a scent, a song, a final warmth on the wrist.
  </p>

  <h3>Challenges and Ethical Dilemmas</h3>
  <p>
    Not all is ideal. Communities without access to Evoke risk being forgotten. Wealthier individuals curate “sharper,” more lasting memories, while others fade into digital silence. Emotional memories, especially trauma, can be edited or suppressed, raising concerns about consent, truth, and manipulation. Some people become nostalgic addicts, replaying the past rather than facing the present.
  </p>

  <h3>New Forms of Solidarity and Sharing</h3>
  <p>
    Despite these concerns, Evoke fosters empathy and cultural exchange. “Memory swaps” in community centers become rituals, where people share everything from family traditions to lost languages. These acts build solidarity — not based on shared facts, but on shared feelings.
  </p>

  <h3>Remembering as Resistance</h3>
  <p>
    In this future, remembering is no longer passive. It's political. Communities use Evoke to archive erased histories, to protect endangered cultures, or to resist forgetting. Memory becomes a way to fight injustice, reclaim space, and create bonds across time.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Evoke demonstrates how technology can make memory a shared, multisensory language. It opens new doors for empathy, cultural continuity, and personal storytelling. However, it also raises questions of power and bias, along with ethical issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Memory is no longer passive, it's curated, stored, and sometimes even sold. Evoke asks us to reflect not just on the past, but on how we build the future. In making memory material, it changes the way we live and the way we connect.
